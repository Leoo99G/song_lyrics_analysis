# Song Lyrics Analysis Project

This repository contains code and data for analyzing song lyrics to explore cultural trends, emotional expression, and linguistic evolution over time. The analysis covers a dataset comprising the lyrics of the top-10 songs in the US from 1950 to 2019.

## Overview

Analyzing song lyrics offers a unique perspective on cultural trends, emotional expression, and linguistic evolution over time. However, this type of analysis presents specific challenges not commonly encountered in more traditional forms of text analysis. Firstly, the software tools traditionally employed for text analytics are often not well-suited for processing the creative and informal language commonly found in lyrics. Slang, colloquial expressions, and artistic deviations from standard grammar can obscure the true meaning or sentiment of the words, complicating efforts to analyze them with typical natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

## Data

The dataset used in this analysis comprises the lyrics of the top-10 songs in the US from 1950 to 2019. It includes information about each song's lyrics, release year, artist, and other relevant attributes.
